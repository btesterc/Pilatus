Welcome, brave hero!

You've made it to the summit of the legendary Mount Pilatus, and your adventure begins here. Your mission? To gather as many treasures as you can while facing dazzling dragons, rescuing captured royalty, unearthing great fortunes, and completing heroic feats that will ultimately lead to saving the world!

But there’s a twist — your greatest tools are not swords or shields, but your mastery of the command line, GIT, and GITHUB. Every step you take, every treasure you find, will rely on your skills with these powerful technologies.

Fear not, for this journey is meant to be fun and challenging, but never impossible. As long as you give your best effort, defeat is not an option.

So! Go to the CAVE!
